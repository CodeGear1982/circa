Performance notes 12/29/13

 - Biggest perf issue is within interpreter (ie, not related to drawing or external calls)
 - Loops are the worst. (the "draw asteroids" loop is a huge one)
 - Tracing shows a ton of time in vm_run_input_bytecodes.
   - In particular, the :multiple prop check.

Fix ideas:
 - Don't have separate register lists for minor blocks
 - Math bytecodes
 - Inline small functions
 - Unroll loops
