Keyboard metaphors for movement:
  - 'next' and 'previous' - context sensitive browsing
  - 'parent' - input of current term
  - 'child' - user of current term

Browsing:
  This is a context sensitive way to browse through multiple terms. There are
  various commands which return a list (or iterator) of terms as a result, and
  the keys to explore this list are the same.

  Example usage:
    1. User clicks 'parent' while on a term that has multiple inputs
    2. Start browsing all inputs. Current selection goes to input 0
    3. User clicks n,p to cycle through inputs
  
  Keys:
    n,p : next, previous
    1..9 : select by index
    a : select all

  - Change value (for values)
