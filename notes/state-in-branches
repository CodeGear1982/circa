So we have this idea that you can have persistent state associated with control flow.

Like, if you call a stateful function twice, then some piece of memory is allocated for
each call.

In initial experiments, this is a really cool feature. Drawing a fractal tree became
absurdly easy. It's likely that it will help with other things too.

Right now, this works for function calls.

TODO
It doesn't work for for-loops. It should. Each iteration of a for-loop should have
a separate branch.

OPTIMIZATION

At some point, we'll need to optimize this. We can't go around copying the entirety
of a for loop block for every iteration. Need to design it so that we only copy the
stateful things.
