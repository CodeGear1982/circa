# Graph view details #

Each node has:
  * Name
  * Lines to inputs
  * Function
 
# To create a new term:

1) Pick a function, perhaps by typing it, or by clicking an existing one.
   Editor now enters a 'create-term' mode where this function is displayed.
2) Pick inputs, perhaps by clicking on them in order.

# Specifying location: by default, a new term is placed immediately after its
  latest input. Could also have some way to specify location.

# View idea:
    Organize terms to look just like source code, but superimpose boxes & lines, to
    highlight graph structure.
