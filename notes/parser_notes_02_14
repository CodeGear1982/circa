Need to fix parser errors.

Currently:
  If parser encounters something it doesn't expect, it throws out the remainder of the current
  line and then continues.

  This has disasterous results if a there are mismatched brackets.

  a = (  ....  ])

  Here the ']' is unexpected, this will cause us to discard the ] and ). Since the opening
  '(' has yet to be closed, we'll now consume the result of the file as if it's inside
  the parens, which ruins the entire parse.


Strategies for Circa:

  (no) Space-separated expressions should be disallowed inside ()s and maybe {}s
  Maybe: Unindenting inside brackets is an error
  Maybe: Mismatched parens causes a fatal parser error

Fixes:

  On error, don't discard tokens.
  If we're expecting a closing bracket and we find a different closing bracket or EOF, fatal error.
    Maybe in the future, this fatal error could be turned into something smarter. But, might as
      well follow convention for now.


Survey of other languages:

  Python
    Unindenting inside ()s is fine
    Parser stops at first compile error
    Difference between statements & expressions, so an error is usually noticed much sooner

  Coffeescript
    Unindenting inside ()s is an error
    Parser stops at first compile error
