Invariants for Term / Block connections:

A Term's input:

  (1) must occur before the term
    (side note: I think there is an exception to this, when working with looped values)

  (3) must not be the term itself.

  (4) must be in the same major block, unless it is a nonlocal() term
    If it is a nonlocal() term, the input must be in the nearest parent major block.
    The nonlocal() input cannot skip a major block.

  (5) must not be in a different compilation unit. (this is a consequence of (2) )
