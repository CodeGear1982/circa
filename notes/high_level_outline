High level goals:

 - Code is easy to introspect, visualize, modify. Want to enable the use of
   in-game code editors
 - Live reloading is supported really well
 - Code is stored as text. It can be created in non-text ways, but it can always
   be saved back to text.
 - Targeted at game development

Consequently, high-level implementation:
 - Code format is dataflow based
 - "state" data is declared
 - Easy bindings to C and C++



 - Can intermediate results be inspected?
 - Should we share values among terms? How important is that?
   * How to share values? Garbage collection?

 - What should the C binding look like?
