# WISH LIST #

# Defects #
 - clear_branch and repair_broken_links don't correctly handle nested names

# Miscellaneous #
 - Need a variant of include() that doesn't expose names 
 - More sanity when message passing.
     See lincoln.ca for how crazy it is
 - delta() should work on lists
 - For-loop index() function

# Types #
 - Collapse 'null' and 'void' into the same type
 - Remove initialize() from simple_handle
 - Deprecate the way change_type() calls initialize()

# Parser work #
 - Switch statement
 - Enums
 - [low] omit ()s on method calls
 - allow for @ syntax on complex lexprs
 - Initialize an object with named fields

# Function declaration #
 - Implicit return type for subroutines
 - Declare a block that doesn't have an end marker (ends at EOF)
 - Cleaner syntax for a function that rebinds input
 - Declare a function with multiple outputs with Circa code

# Optimization tasks #
 - Value sharing, especially for Dict. Lots of performance loss in preserve_state_result.
 - Some overloads that are currently resolved dynamically can be resolved statically
