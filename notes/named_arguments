Need to support named arguments.

Example:

def get_distance(Point a, Point b)
end

can be called like:

get_distance(b: [1 0], a: [5 3])

In compiled code, the inputs should be arranged in the correct order. Reasons:
 - Faster for the executing function
 - Easier for introspection, avoids confusion

Argument name is a source-code-level concern. Need to store their usage of argument names:

  syntax:input-X:argument_name
