When a script is modified, here are the steps that need to happen:

Modification check
  Look at every module
    If the source filename is changed, load the new branch
    Keep track of the old branch
    Update this module reference
    For every existing module (other than this one)
      Migrate any references within the reloaded module
    For every piece of top-level state (actor state)
      Migrate any references within the reloaded module
