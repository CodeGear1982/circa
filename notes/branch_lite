Outline

  a BranchLite object serves the same role as a Branch, but is more lightweight,
  it doesn't use full Term objects or real pointers.

Goals
  Use this data structure for efficient evaluation. Before evaluating we do a quick
  process generating a BranchLite from Branch, the BranchLite has unnecessary stuff
  stripped out and derived information added.

  Use this data as a starting point for more layered code generation. We could have
  a whole chain of:
    [User's intensional branch] -> [Codegen step] -> [...] -> [Efficient evaluation branch]

Data

BranchLite
  List of Terms
  Pointer to base branch
