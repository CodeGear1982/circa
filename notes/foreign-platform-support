Outline

  Use a foreign VM to run Circa code

Goals

  Good performance
  Interopability
  Support multiple platforms
  Leverage external platform libraries

Strategies
  In the 1st pass, we definitely want to embed the VM, and rely on native C funcs
  Send generated source code to VM?
    This method has other workflow advantages
  Send something lower level to VM?
    Speed advantages, but probably not worth the trouble

  We'll regenerate source on first load, and whenever the Circa structures are changed.

Candidates
  v8
  Lua
  Mono

Implementation ideas

  Native functions should receive a Context object or something, which is an
  interface to the outside world
  
  Context provides:
    Input & Output values
    Source term (maybe only certain funcs need this?)
      Term allows access to branch, etc
    Declared type of inputs & outputs
    Reflection on interpreter?
    Is this enough?

  During runtime, we keep a link to a Program object.
  Each Circa function must be translated into an entity in the Program
  On each Branch, store some metadata associating it with a Program object
  If a Circa function is changed then the Program entry is regenerated
