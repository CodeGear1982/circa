For loops are strange in a dataflow world

Here's what we have:

(Some chunk of code)

     A B  C
     |/   |
     V    V
     D    E

(Then a for loop)

 for(iterable)
 -------------
     D  
     |
     V
     F
 -------------

 (Then the rest of the code:

     F  E
     |  |
     V  V
     G  H



We want to take D and E, stick them in our loop, reapply the loop X times, then
allow the rest of the code to use the results

Can think of this like a function.

D_c = value(typeof(D))
in innerBranch, remap D to D_c
on for loop start, copy D to D_c
at end of each loop, assign(D_result, D_c)
after the last loop, assign(D_result, F)
