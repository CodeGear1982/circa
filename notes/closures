Implementation notes for closure:

- At the time of closure creation
    Find the function
    Identify the function's outer inputs
    Count how many stack frames are needed
    Create limited copies of the outer stack frames. These copies will include:
      Branch pointers
      Register list with value copies of only the used values
      Don't need registers for the target function, but we do need a Branch pointer
    Wrap all that up, it's our closure

- At the time of closure evaluation
    Push every stack frame (?)
    Push the target function
    Continue as normal, target function will find inputs
    Pop all our stack frames
      Mark each frame as belonging to a closure, so that we know how many to pop
    Potential problem: too many frames on stack?
