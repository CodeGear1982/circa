Thinking about whether to have Symbols.

Useful as an identifying element. Very commonly the subject of a switch statement.

[:location [:x 10] [:y 10]]

Are they essentially strings? What if we just stored symbols as strings?

['location' ['x' 10] ['y' 10]]

The nice thing about a symbol, is that it's distinct from a regular value. Say we have
the following pattern:

  f() may return
    <any value>
      or
    [:symbol <some other value>]

In order to avoid problems, we must guarantee that the second form does not overlap
with the first form.

If symbols are strings, then this is harder. We must guarantee that the value isn't
a string with the particular value.

If symbols are not strings, then it's easier, we just need to guarantee that the value
doesn't have the symbol type. It can be a string of any value.

We would still need to worry about the case where <any value> is a symbol. So, it's not
really any value, it's any non-symbol value.

If we really want to guarantee that a value is distinct, we can create a local type for
that.
