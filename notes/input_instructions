Callsite - The location in code where a function call is made
Callee - The code being called

The job of the input instructions is to translate values from the calling
scope to the callee's scope, by looking at the callsite inputs and the
callee's input slots.

Things that may happen during input population:

  Flat one-for-one input copy
    Input copy may need casts. For now, always cast.
    Future: Optimize away casts when possible.

  Collect remaining incoming inputs into a list
    Depends on callee definition

  Future: Rearrange inputs that used named-input syntax

  Fail due to mismatch of input count

  Populate a value of 'null' for a missing input.

Things that may happen during output population:

  Flat one-for-one output copy
  Collect all outputs into a list
