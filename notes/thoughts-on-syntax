Doing a survey of syntax used in other languages. Here are some thoughts that relate to Circa:

Using {} for blocks?
  There seems to be some universal feeling that this is used for heavyweight languages
  People like 'end' in Ruby

names have no type in Ruby
  We work the same way. It's good.
  Though it might be nice to have a compiler hint pass that warns when a name changes type

Array literals
  [] or {} ?
  Prefer []

Everything is an expression
  Probably a good thing

Method names ending in ? or !
  This is a Rubyism that they can keep
  Planning on using the ? mark for other purposes


For loops
  for i in list
  for i : list
  for (i in list)
  for (i : list)
  for Type i in list
  for Type i : list

Type labels
  int myInt
  myInt::int
  myInt [::int]
  myInt [t:int]
  for i [::int] in list
  for (i [::int] in list)

Method chaining
  Important to make this easy
  blah().foo().baz()
  blah.foo.baz
