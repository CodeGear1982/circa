PARSING PROCESS

Step 1: Scan the entire input for fatal parsing errors.

When there's a compile error, we want to fail gracefully. It would be nice to return
a bunch of code which is mostly correct, but only has a few error terms.

Step 1: Search for totally unrecoverable errors. Reject entire string
  - This section can include unmatched block start/ends, like a 'for' with no 'end'
    Any attempt to parse a string like that will probably be completely wrong

Step 2: Parse and create terms. Individual terms can result in errors, but we try to
  recover from errors, and smoothly parse the entire input.
