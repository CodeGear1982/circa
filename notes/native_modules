Some notes on our requirements for a native module system.

Various needs:

 - Ease of writing native code
 - Live loading of shared libraries

The following workflow would be super rad:

 - Load shared library, bind native functions to Circa functions, use, etc.
 - Make a change to native code
 - Circa notices the source file change, initiates compiler
 - Compiler produces a shared library
 - Circa unloads the old shared library and loads the new one
 - New code is executed
