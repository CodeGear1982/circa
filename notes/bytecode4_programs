Thinking about having Bytecode be stored separately from Branch

There would be a new data structure, BytecodeSet or Program or BytecodeBlock

This would hold pieces of bytecode for several Branches at once

When a piece of bytecode has a Jump (referencing a branch), it would use
an internal index within the BytecodeSet to point to another branch. Or,
the Jump operation could specify that the target bytecode hasn't been
generated yet, and the bytecode for the target branch could be added on the fly.

Once the caller is able to control their own BytecodeSet, they will be able to
have their own custom evaluation settings, their own optimizations, etc, which
would not affect other users of the same Branch.
