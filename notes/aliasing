Different ways to introduce aliasing:

as() function checks if type is alias, and finds the real data.
  Can be expanded to a whole 'type resolution search'
  Adds the ability to do referencing-counting for any type
  Allows for other stuff?

Change the ->value pointer to point at the real data.
  This breaks a lot of assumptions.

Different kinds of aliasing:

Alias:
  Want to refer to another piece of data, without duplicating or taking it.

Reference counting:
  Each term points to the same piece of data
  alloc / dealloc will change the reference count
  Should silently act like it's the original type
