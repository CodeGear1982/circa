Initial notes for a plan of javascript generation..

 - Primary goal would be speed; taking advantage of the v8 (or whatever) javascript compiler.
 - Secondary goal would be AOT compilation, to be able to run a Circa-created program without runtime.

Other considerations:
 - Would be nice to switch out the code target later.


Technical outline:
 - run_bytecode would be eliminated
 - most stuff inside interpreter.cpp would be eliminated
 - how can this approach even work, since most funcs need access to tagged_value funcs?

 - Things that would remain:
  - Our structs for Type, Function, Term, Block
  - Native patch
