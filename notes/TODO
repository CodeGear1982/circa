Short todos:
 - Remove special syntax for to_ref, rename to ref()

Bugs:

 - Can't comment out something inside of a literal list

 - Complex lvalues don't work.
     Doesn't work: something.field += x
     Doesn't work: something.field[i] = x

 - When reloading a branch, we need to search the whole world for references to the 
   old state, and update those references.

 - 'do once' needs to export name bindings. Maybe just make this syntactic sugar for if() ?

Tasks:
 - Value sharing
 - Lambdas
 - How to support introspection inside blocks (for, if, include). Should the user need to provide
   names or can we provide default names? Can the user provide a name if they want?
 - Store whether a function is pure

Big tasks:
 - Parametrized/generic types
 - Recursion
 - JIT compilation
 - C reproduction
