-- Type-safe pointers --

Generic types can have references to 'any'.

Have a named-parameter function which takes 'any' and gives it a name.

Generic types can have references to the results of named-parameter.

Have a specialize-type function which replaces 'any' pointers with other types.

Every type has a list of parameters.

-- value function reuse --

Every type owns its 'value' function.

-- Type using subroutines --

In order to have types that expand upon other types, we need type's functions
to be stored as subroutines. How much work would this require?
