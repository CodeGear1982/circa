Right now we duplicate tons of data and it's really inefficient.

Need two kinds of optimizations:

1) Data aliasing

Values that are pointer-based and copy()ed should share the same objects, as long as
their values can be shared safely.

2) Value stealing

Say we have:

   a = some intermediate value
   b = f(a)

If we know that B is the only user of A, and we know that the function f() wants to
output a value that is really similar to A, then B should *steal* the output value
of A and use it as its output.
