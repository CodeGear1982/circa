* Every term has a user-given string name. This name may be blank.
* This name is not unique, even within the branch.
    But we do have special treatment for terms which share a name within a branch

* Every term also has a globally unique ID
    But this is only really useful for debugging
    Duplicating a branch will create terms with different globalIDs

* It might be useful for each term to have a branch-local ID. That is, an ID which is unique
  within their branch.

We could use the term's index for this purpose, but that might not be stable enough.
