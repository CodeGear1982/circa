Regular code:
    Mostly dataflow
    pack_state calls are sprinkled as needed
    Name rebindings can result in extra outputs from a minor branch

With exit points
    In-progress name rebindings must become real outputs
    pack_state should be after the exiting call (might need to catch extra outputs)
    exit_point() call must be placed after the exiting call
    pack_state needs to be run on exit

Maybe an alternate implementation:
    An exiting call causes a new implicit output, 'exiting'

New plan:
    
    When an exiting call is triggered, it passes true to an exit_point call
    The exit_point checks its 1st parameter, if it's true, then it moves the current
      frame's PC to the end of the frame, and it copies its inputs to be the frame's
      outputs.

    For an exit inside a minor branch
    There is an implicit value #exiting that is added to the if-block

    After the block, there is an exit_point() call that receives the #exiting value.

    If true, this exit_point will finish the current frame, and the #exiting value
    will propogate upwards.

    If there is implicit state, the pack_state() call can be placed in front of
    exit_point().

Suggestions:
    Instead of boolean #exiting, maybe a Name value, so that we can distinguish
    between break and continue.
