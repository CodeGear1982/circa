The Interpreter Loop
--------------------


Starting a new interpreter session
 - Make sure Branches have resolved pending updates
 - Check to update context to latest branches
 - (These steps should not be done on every iteration)


On each step, here are the actions we might do:

 - Open a new frame
   - Choose which branch to use
     - If_block choosing may cause error
   - New frame may be for an override call
     - Override call may cause error
   - Copy each input to the new frame
     - Input copying may cause error
 - Advance across an empty term
 - Finish the current frame (if PC is at the end)
   - Stop, if this is the last frame
   - Copy each output to above frame
     - Output copying may cause error
 - Evaluate in-place (for output_placeholder & others)


Can simplify:
  - While not interrupted
    - Perform step
