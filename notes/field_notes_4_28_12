Message passing is pretty nice
Writing message switches is not the best, but not that bad. Could be improved
by a mechanism that automatically detects an unhandled message, and offers
to help write a new case.

Error handling is lacking (I think it's ignoring errors right now?)
Easy to crash the system with bad type
  Cast errors should at the very least, prevent the function from being called.

When writing code that references Branches and Terms, we have the problem that
code reloading causes the old thing to be destroyed.

 - We could fix this so that the old Branch / Term becomes immutable when referenced,
   so that we can always refer to the old version
 - But, we don't need this right now. (we might need it some day)
 - Referring to the old thing will probably be useful some day, but
