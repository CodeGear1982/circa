Garbage collection isn't ubiquitous- it's possible for a custom type to implement manual
memory management.

Some data structures used by the runtime *are* garbage collected (because it would be
too messy otherwise). Garbage collected data structures include:

  Type
  Branch and Term
  Function
  EvalContext
