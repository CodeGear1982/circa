Revisiting the way on-demand eval is done.

In the new scheme:

When a nonlocal() input is encountered.
If the value is not found
  Push a call to the builtin func eval_term_on_demand(term)
  Inside this func:
    Fetch every module-frame value for this term
    Call the func
    Save the result in module-frame
    Return result

In Stack.eval_on_demand
  Mostly the same deal
  Might need a hackset to tell the VM to stop at a certain frame
