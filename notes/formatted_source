Need to rewrite all the existing source-reproduction stuff, but allow for rich formatting.

Goals:
 - Easy conversion from rich-text to plain source. Eventually replace the plain source version.
 - No wasteful string duplication.
 - Each text snippet can be colored, hovered over, and clicked.
 - Ability to add more annotations as needed.
 - Section rewriting is efficient.


Every formatted source item should have:
 - Ref to relevant term
 - String contents
 - Highlight class

Style:
