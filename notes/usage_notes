This page contains notes from the front lines; ideas from actual usage

Enum type would be great
Ability to do dynamic typing is really helpful
Often you want to have a reference to an item in a list. Possible to do this in a typesafe way? Can this be used as an lexpr?
Switch expressions used constantly, maybe have 1 or more special syntaxes
Fix how functions can be vectorized, currently it usually doesn't work
Would be great to tweak constants inside of functions
