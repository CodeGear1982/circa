Type philosophy:

 - Type names are optional
 - Compiler will find inferred types whenever possible
 - The user should use explicit type names when:
   - The compiler isn't able to do inferrence, and needs some help
   - To act as an assertion

Types are needed:
 - To resolve overloaded functions
 - To raise static errors around bad function usage
 - Hints for code optimization
 - Hints for editor
 - Displayed during introspection
 - Garbage collection, deallocation
