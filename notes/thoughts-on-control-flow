Hey, we probably need a way to have control flow. Been punting on this so far.

* Types of control flow operations:

  - Block-level 'break'
    Named break?
  - Function-level 'return'
  - Program-level 'exit'
  - Loops
  - Goto


* How do we do feedback on code that has breaks?

function(inputs)
  if(cond)
    return result
end

func(x) := y

Need to know if (cond) was true or not

The solution would be to check every single return statement, and see which execution condition
was true.

Maybe do a hybrid of execution / dataflow (like everything else we do)

The actual return value could be represented as if-exprs, but we could allow for a 'break' statement
to cancel further execution.
