For each branch, track whether it's 'effectual' or not.

We can separate branches into these groups:

  Implicitly no-effect
    Empty or contains only calls to no-effect functions
    Does not contain a C override

  Explicitly no-effect
    Annotated with an explicit 'no-effect' label
    May contain a C override

  Effectual branches
    Contains a call to an effectual function
    Or, contains a C override, and does not have a no-effect label.
