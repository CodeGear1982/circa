Need to figure out what to do about coercion

Problem #1: I want to write '1' and have it be used as a float.

Different approaches:
  - Store every number as a float
  - Store every number as a bignum

Plan
  - Add 'as_number', an accessor which converts ints to floats
  - Add 'set_float'
  - Discourage as_float
  - Remove int-to-float. Calling func(float) with an int is accepted
