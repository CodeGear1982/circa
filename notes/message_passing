Need a high-level way of passing around data.

Calling code says:

send('channel.name', [1 2 3])

Receiving code gets:

messages = receive('channel.name')

 * How to display in a visual way? Incoming/outgoing messages should probably be some sort of
   cloud icon.
 * How to watch and see what is happening? Need some sort of history graph for sent messages.

* Message passing is bad
 - Code which can do the same thing without message passing is better, because it's easier
   to introspect.
 - Maybe an alternate syntax would be easier to introspect? Restrictions such as one sender,
   one receiver, and ordering (send comes before receive) would each help.

* How to discourage?
 - Transform code to remove message pass?
