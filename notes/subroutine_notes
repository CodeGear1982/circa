Subroutine:

This is like a 'mini-network' of terms. It includes special terms like 'this' and placeholders for inputs.

What are the different strategies for storing subroutines?

1) Seperate code units. The Module object keeps a list
2) As branches
3) Code unit is pythonValue of a constant term

When we call a subroutine, what happens?

1) Code can get copied and inlined
2) Create a 'subroutine declaration' term, it points to a commonly-used code unit. On execution, it fills in values for 'this' and inputs

... How do we handle backpropagation if they are sharing a code unit? Does this problem go away if the backprop function is generated? (I think so)
