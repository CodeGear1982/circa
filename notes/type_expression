Need a way to store a complex type as a value.

Examples of complex types:

 - Maybe<T>
 - Either T or V
 - Specialized generic

Each type can itself refer to more complex types.

At the bottom is a 'concrete type'. This type actually has allocation & deallocation
functions. Any given value must have a concrete type. The value can then be described
as a complex type.

Can we efficiently store complex types in memory?
