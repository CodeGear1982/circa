dynamic_method currently has some problems

The question is, how do we dynamically call a method that wants to rebind the 1st input?

This is pretty common.

We could assume that the dot.syntax is a clue meaning, "the left-hand side of the dot is always
available to be rebound". (like the @ symbol in other contexts)

So dynamic_method is always assumed to rebind the 1st arg. The call-site will always have the
extra_output term.

What if dynamic_method ends up calling a method that *doesn't* rebind 1st arg? Somebody needs
to copy the 1st input to the extra_output. Who will do this?

We can introduce bytecode that helps out with managing outputs. It would work just like
the input instruction list. In this bytecode, one of the options is to copy an input.
