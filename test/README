This folder contains a suite of tests.

Each test script exists in the local circa/ folder, and is listed in the
'test_manifest' file.

Currently we only do output-based tests. The test harness will run the
script and look for a file named (filename).expected_output, and verify
that the script outputs the same contents as this file.

There's a command in the /bin folder called ca-test, which will run these
tests.
