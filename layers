High-level overview of what is happening:

Bottom layer:

Executable dataflow graph
Can be compiled into LLVM and then run with no help from the host

Next layer:

Operations that read/modify the dataflow graph.

In certain instances, this must happen at run-time.  We must provide built-ins
so that these operations are possible from code.

We must do what we can to:
a) reduce how often this must happen
b) minimize how much recalculation must be done when one of these changes occur.

Next layer:

Wholesale reading/modification of code. Here there is no restriction on the scope of
the changes we are allowed to perform.
