  Each branch should store the base indent level (instead of having this data in Term)

Code cleanup
  Remove importing_macros.h
  Deprecate API using Term* or Function* to reference functions (prefer Branch*)
  Eliminate hosted Function type, in favor of Branch.
  Eliminate C++ Function type, in favor of Branch.

Code modification
  Code modification should go through a more controlled path.
    Add a CodeModification class that stores a modification in progress
    Add a global apply_modification() function that invokes it.
    Alternately, require that modifications must be passed through message-send
      One goal is that modifications should be able to be sent remotely

Big Features
  Proper module system
  Possibly get rid of separate 'int' type, and just use numbers. Replace with some other
    system that can detect when an expression will always be an integer.
