Tests/bugs:
  Test: Point + number, Point + int

  Test throwing errors inside blocks and subroutines. Many errors show up with
  'no error found'

Bugs:

 - Assignment operator should only be allowed to work on values
   Priority: Low (Assignment is discouraged)

 - Assignment to a field does not work
   Like this: point.x := 1
   Priority: Low (Assignment is discouraged)

 - Can't comment out something inside of a literal list

 - Complex lvalues don't work.
  
   Doesn't work: something.field += x
   Doesn't work: something.field[i] = x

 - When reloading a branch, we need to search the whole world for references to the 
   old state, and update those references.

 - 'do once' needs to export name bindings. Maybe just make this syntactic sugar for if() ?

 - typeof() should return a reference not a value

Tasks:
 - Need an efficient + safe way to share output values across terms
 - Block syntax, like how it's easy to pass a block in ruby

Big tasks:
 - Parametrized/generic types
 - LLVM integration. (need to investigate this enough to learn what it would look like)
 - Access and edit properties from circa
 - C reproduction.
