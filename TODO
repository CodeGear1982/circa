Bugs/tasks:
 - BranchIterator could be better behaved when a term is inserted. Currently, inserting a term before the iterator will cause it->current() to return something else.

 - This syntax error isn't handled well:
     function( end
    It should throw an error on encountering the unexpected 'end'

 - Color math is kind of weird and has lots of pitfalls, perhaps we just need blend_color().

 - List syntax [] should just call list(), shouldn't try to create a branch

 - Remaining things using branch-based types should use list_t

 - Add dictionary_t and map_t

 - Can't use a namespace qualifier on a type name in function declaration

 - Can't comment out something inside of a literal list

 - Complex lvalues don't work.
     Doesn't work: something.field += x
     Doesn't work: something.field[i] = x

 - When reloading a branch, we need to search the whole world for references to the 
   old branch, and update those references.

 - 'do once' needs to export name bindings. Maybe just make this syntactic sugar for if() ?

 - Lambdas
 - How to support introspection inside blocks (for, if, include). Should the user need to provide
   names or can we provide default names? Can the user provide a name if they want?
 - Store whether a function is pure

Big tasks:
 - Parametrized/generic types
 - Recursion
 - JIT compilation
 - C reproduction
