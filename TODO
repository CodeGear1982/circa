Bugs:

 - Can't comment out something inside of a literal list

 - Complex lvalues don't work.
     Doesn't work: something.field += x
     Doesn't work: something.field[i] = x

 - When reloading a branch, we need to search the whole world for references to the 
   old state, and update those references.

 - 'do once' needs to export name bindings. Maybe just make this syntactic sugar for if() ?

Tasks:
 - Value sharing
 - Lambdas
 - Type should be branch-based
 - Should the user be able to specify names of blocks? (for,if)

Big tasks:
 - Parametrized/generic types
 - JIT compilation
 - C reproduction.
