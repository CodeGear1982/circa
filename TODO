This is a list of short-term TODOs. There's a bigger list at docs/todo.md

 - 'Unknown identifier' terms are being created without source location
 - clear_branch and repair_broken_links don't correctly handle nested names
 - Declare a function with multiple outputs in Circa
 - Deprecate the way change_type() calls initialize()
 - Remove initialize() from simple_handle
 - Collapse 'null' and 'void' into the same type

Important optimization tasks:

 - Value sharing, especially for Dict. Lots of performance loss in preserve_state_result.
 - Some overloads that are currently resolved dynamically can be resolved statically

Things that would have made lincoln.ca easier:
 - More sane message passing
 - More object methods
 - Not all terms have location
 - Subroutines don't need to explicity declare output type
 - Declare a block that doesn't have an end marker (ends at file)
 - Rebind syntax on lexprs
 - Object methods don't need ()
