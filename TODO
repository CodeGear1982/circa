This is a list of short-term TODOs. There's a bigger list at docs/todo.md

 - 'Unknown identifier' terms are being created without source location
 - various places where swap() can be used instead of copy()

Important optimization tasks:

 - Value sharing, especially for Dict. Lots of performance loss in preserve_state_result.
 - Some overloads that are currently resolved dynamically can be resolved statically
