BUGS:

- Prefix operators. Need to support -x
- Parsing errors not handled well (we usually crash)
  - need to display location of compile errors
- Ambiguity with lists and x -y (this could mean [(x - y)] or [x, -y])
- migrate_values has terrible performance
- When rebinding names inside 'if', need to handle names which are rebound in both sides (but
  not yet bound in outer branch)
- Need array access[0] operator
- Need elif

IMPORTANT THINGS:
- Cool graphical demo
- Parametrized types, lists and stuff

FUTURE THINGS:
- LLVM integration. Need to investigate this enough to learn what it would look like.
- Access and edit properties from circa
- Lambdas
- C reproduction.
