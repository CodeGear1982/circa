This is a list of short-term TODOs. There's a bigger list at docs/todo.md
 - Need a variant of include() that doesn't expose names 
 - clear_branch and repair_broken_links don't correctly handle nested names
 - Declare a function with multiple outputs in Circa
 - Deprecate the way change_type() calls initialize()
 - Remove initialize() from simple_handle
 - Collapse 'null' and 'void' into the same type

Important optimization tasks:

 - Value sharing, especially for Dict. Lots of performance loss in preserve_state_result.
 - Some overloads that are currently resolved dynamically can be resolved statically

Things that would have made lincoln.ca easier:
 - More sane message passing
 - Subroutines don't need to explicity declare output type
 - Declare a block that doesn't have an end marker (ends at file)
 - Rebind syntax on lexprs
 - Object methods don't need ()

Things learned from ropetest.ca:
 - Cleaner syntax for a function that rebinds input
 - For-loop type inferrence
 - For-loop index() function
 - delta() on lists
 - Object initializer
 - Situation where a list needed to be wrapped in Point()
