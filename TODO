Top 5 worst issues
  - Type inference fails in for-loop
  - Type inference fails when using add_s or add_v
  - ...

Source repro
  Each branch should store the base indent level (instead of having this data in Term)

Code reload
  Bug fix, don't reload if the file has just been written and its size is 0. Maybe have a delay

Code cleanup
  Remove importing_macros.h
  Deprecate API using Term* or Function* to reference functions (prefer Branch*)
  Eliminate C++ Function type, in favor of Branch.

Parser
  In function decl, type should be optional (rather than name being optional)

  Newlines don't work in some infix_expr. Example
    if (something
         or something_else)
    if something or
         something_else

  Can't use comments inside type declaraion?


Code modification
  Code modification should go through a more controlled path.
    Add a CodeModification class that stores a modification in progress
    Add a global apply_modification() function that invokes it.
    Alternately, require that modifications must be passed through message-send
      One goal is that modifications should be able to be sent remotely

Big Features
  Proper module system
  Possibly get rid of separate 'int' type, and just use numbers. Replace with some other
    system that can detect when an expression will always be an integer.
