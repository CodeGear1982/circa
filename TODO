Required features before public exposure:
- Parsing errors not handled well (we usually crash)
  - need to display location of compile errors
X Support optional type annotations
- Cool graphical demo

Need to have soon:
X Type coersion is very poor, especially int-to-float and float-to-int
- Parametrized types, lists and stuff

Other todos:
- LLVM integration. Need to investigate this enough to learn what it would look like.
- Access and edit properties from circa
- Lambdas
- C reproduction.
