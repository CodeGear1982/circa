BUGS:

- Prefix operators. Need to support -x
- Ambiguity with lists and x -y (this could mean [(x - y)] or [x, -y])
- Need array access[0] operator
- Need elif

IMPORTANT THINGS:
- Cool graphical demo
- Parametrized types, lists and stuff

FUTURE THINGS:
- LLVM integration. Need to investigate this enough to learn what it would look like.
- Access and edit properties from circa
- Lambdas
- C reproduction.
