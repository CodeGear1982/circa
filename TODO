This is a list of short-term TODOs. There's a bigger list at docs/todo.md

 - Plastic no longer reloads scripts when they encounter an error

 - BranchIterator could be better behaved when a term is inserted. Currently, inserting a term before the iterator will cause it->current() to return something else.
 - evaluate_if_block should not use if_block_contains_state, it's O(n) 
 - various places where swap() can be used instead of copy()

Important optimization tasks:

 - Value sharing, especially for Dict. Lots of performance loss in preserve_state_result.
 - Use swap instead of copy for inputs (when possible)
 - Don't check locals size in get_local
 - Some overloads that are currently resolved dynamically can be resolved statically
