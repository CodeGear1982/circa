-- Bug repro, the bug occurred under the following circumstances:
--  1) Recursive call to a stateful func
--  2) Call occurred inside if-block case
--  3) The case already had a stateful var

def recr(int depth)

    print('reached depth = ' depth)
    if depth == 0
        return

    if true
        state s = depth
        recr(depth - 1)
        s = s * 2

s = null
recr(3, state = s)
print('after 1st iter: ' s)
recr(3, state = s)
print('after 2nd iter: ' s)
recr(3, state = s)
print('after 3rd iter: ' s)
