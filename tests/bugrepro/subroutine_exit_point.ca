-- This bug was a two-parter. The for loop was leaking a #control value, and
-- the subroutine definition was creating an unnecessary exit_point. The end
-- result is that the branch would exit after the subroutine def.

print('check 1')

for i in [1]
    discard

def f()
    return

print('check 2')
