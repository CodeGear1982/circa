-- The cause of this bug was that type_decl was unnecessarily calling block->moveToEnd
-- to reposition the result. This was messing up the generation of pack_state terms.
-- (Update 9/2013: Disregard above comment, pack_state was factored out)

def f()
    state a = 1

    struct T {
    }

    state b = 2

int = make_vm(f)
int.call
print(int.get_state)
