Struct work:
* Add parser support to make struct types
* Add code to ca_struct to instantiate structs
* Add support where a type name can be used as a function (constructor)
* Add get-field and set-field functions, for structs

Subroutine work:
* Make all subroutines inline (create terms on execute)
* Make sure we are smart about when these terms get created

Source generation work:
* Add to-source-string for all builtin types, for literals
* Add Term.termSyntaxHints, a dynamic set of hints (such as infix vs function call)

Function calls:
* Add support for function overloading by type
