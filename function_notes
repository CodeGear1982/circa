A function:

is represented as a collection of CodeUnits
has inputs and outputs
can be compiled to machine code

Two ways to do function calls:

1. Adding a function call can be considered making an *instance*. Each function call
is a copy of the prototype.
2. Make one common version of the function. Function calls are 'call' terms that
have references to the original function. Add code that will let us cleanly
execute a function call. Stick the inputs in, execute, get the result.

Steps to do #2:

Add parsing code:
  Parse the function header
  Parse the contents, place this in a codeUnit.
  Can we reuse the existing code?

Add execution code:
  Create a 'function-call' term
