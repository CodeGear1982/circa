It's great that we are taking stuff that used to be Python code and making it Circa
code. Such as Feedback.

But these terms shouldn't go in with the output codeunit. They are part of a process
which *creates* the codeunit.

Need to create a seperate 'in-progress' codeunit that is used to produce the actual
codeunit. This could be thrown away once compilation is done.
