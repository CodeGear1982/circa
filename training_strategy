Notes:

Overall goal to support training:

Generate some network of terms that, when evaluated, causes training signals to be propagated upwards. Allow for each function to specify how its piece of the network is created.

Should this be a seperate code unit? Probably


Variable X
  |
  V
Function A
  |
  V
Function B
  |
  V
Implant (with target)


Results in:

Literal, equal to 'target'
  |
  V
passTrainingSignal of Function B
  |
  V
passTrainingSignal of Function A
  |
  V
assign to X
