Need a way to 'override' a function call. This can be used to create things that
act like members.

This requires:
a) A mechanism for declaring a function as overridable
b) Handling the actual override of a function (with equals notation)
c) A way to specify the default of a function
d) A way for the code to intelligently figure out what needs to be reevaluated,
when an override occurs.

Right now this is looking like a layer B operation. Is there a way to do the same thing
in layer A?
