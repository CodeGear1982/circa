= Overriding Functions =

If a user only has a function name, this gives them an UnspecializedFunction object

By providing the input signature, the UnspecializedFunction can give them a specific function (or it can fail).

* Add code for pattern matching?
* Want to allow room for the specialization function to be defined by the user. Then they can do whatever they want.

When the user defines a new function for a different set of types, this is added to the UnspecializedFunction object.
