Need a way to 'override' a function call. This can be used to create things that
act like members.

This requires:
a) A mechanism for declaring a function as overridable
b) Handling the actual override of a function (with equals notation)
c) A way to specify the default of a function
d) A way for the code to intelligently figure out what needs to be reevaluated,
when an override occurs.

This is a layer B operation.

What are the alternatives to do this instead in layer A?


Syntax notes:

Create a new syntax structure 'define' that looks like:

define function_name(inputs)
{

}

Should we reuse existing syntax for a function-definition operation?
