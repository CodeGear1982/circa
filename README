Circa is a programming language designed for rapid development. Some features
are: the ability to introspect and modify the code of a running program, builtin
support for persistence and reloading, and the ability to generate (or recreate)
source code text from compiled code.

There is a nice web site that talks about Circa in more detail here:

Cuttlefish is an SDL-based game engine which tightly integrates with Circa.

The current status of this project is pre-alpha. There are many known issues.
It's not yet recommended for widespread consumption.

The design and implementation was started in 2007 by Andrew Fischer.
