  In rewriting for-loop, shouldn't need an explicit name binding.

    This does work:

      for i in @L
        i = f()

    This doesn't work but we should make it work:

      for i in @L
        f()

  Assigning an element in a type doesn't cast that element. Example:

    type A {
      Point p
    }

    a = A.make
    a.p = [0 0]
    -- a.p is still a List instead of Point

  Method lookup cache:
    Currently does not cache method-on-module-ref, or hashtable value as method.

  load_module should return Func for consistency

  Error trace for dynamic_method: should have the actual method name, when possible.

  A superfluous @ symbol causes problems:

      type A { int i }
      a = make(A)
      @a.i += 4

Source repro
  Each branch should store the base indent level (instead of having this data in Term)

Code reload
  Bug fix, don't reload if the file has just been written and its size is 0. Maybe have a delay?

Modules
  When compiling a module, the last value is automatically turned into an output (just
    like a function). This should probably be explicit for modules?
