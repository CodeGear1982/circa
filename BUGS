 - Subtraction against a literal sometimes doesn't work (depending on if you added a space)
   Can't write this: 1-2

   Priority: Low (Assignment is discouraged)

 - Assignment to a field does not work
   Like this: point.x := 1
   Priority: Low (Assignment is discouraged)

 - If a subroutine is declared with a return type that isn't a valid type, there's
   a runtime abort trap.

 - Returning something in a subroutine with no return type declared, causes an abort trap

 - Can't comment out something inside of a literal list
