  switch can't be used as expression. Example:
      
      x += switch 1
        case 1
          1

  switch-else not implemented?

  "else if" (instead of the correct elif) causes bad parsing. Example:
      if t < 1/6
        p + (q - p) * 6 * t
      else if t < 1/2
        q
      else if t < 2/3
        p + (q - p) * (2/3 - t) * 6
      else
        p

  Defining a method on non-existant type: weird parser errors

  Can't use a type before it's defined. Should be able to post-define it like functions.

  Method lookup cache:
    Currently does not cache method-on-module-ref, or hashtable value as method.

  load_module should return Func for consistency

  Error trace for dynamic_method: should have the actual method name, when possible.

  A superfluous @ symbol causes problems:

      type A { int i }
      a = make(A)
      @a.i += 4

Source repro
  Each branch should store the base indent level (instead of having this data in Term)

Code reload
  Bug fix, don't reload if the file has just been written and its size is 0. Maybe have a delay?

Modules
  When compiling a module, the last value is automatically turned into an output (just
    like a function). This should probably be explicit for modules?
