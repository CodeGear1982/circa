  make 'make' optional on a type. As in, "Type.something" is equivalent to "Type.make.something"
 
  to_string should escape the stuff inside the string.. quotes and newlines and etc.

  Really confusing the way @ symbol is not added to field assignment

    Ex:
      struct.a.b = x

    Seems like @ should be in the mix somewhere.

  Can't use a type before it's defined. Should be able to post-define it like functions?

  A superfluous @ symbol causes problems:

      type A { int i }
      a = make(A)
      @a.i += 4
   
Source repro
  Each branch should store the base indent level (instead of having this data in Term)

Code reload
  Bug fix, don't reload if the file has just been written and its size is 0. Maybe have a delay?

Modules
  When compiling a module, the last value is automatically turned into an output (just
    like a function). This should probably be explicit for modules?

Anonymous functions
  Allow the same input syntax on non-anonymous functions (such as, explicit types, :multiple keyword, and etc)
