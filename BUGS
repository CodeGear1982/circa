  No source location for the contents of { module.:function }
    Fixed now, but need a complete test for source location.

  Type inferrence not working on a call to Type.cast.

  The cached() function is dropping cache on every file reload? shouldn't the block pointer
  be migrated?
    (Before fixing this, remember that the cache *should* be dropped, if the related code
     is modified)

  load_module should return Func for consistency

  Error trace for dynamic_method: should have the actual method name, when possible.
    
  Having a missing ) or ] or } symbol will *really* mess things up. Ditto for an extra ),},]
    Actually quite a lot of syntax errors will mess things up. Syntax error can cause
    a premature end to a block.

  A superfluous @ symbol caused problems:

      type A { int i }
      a = make(A)
      @a.i += 4

  Got unrecognized expression on this string (missing '}'). Worst part is, no error reported.

    clickResolver.call([:add, lineRect, {
            pos = input()
            event = input()

            if event == :right_down
                contextMenu.call(:term_details [line.term pos])
            ])

  Migration failure
    Module Cairo defined type Context
    Another module CodeView used Context as a function argument, like:
      def CodeView.draw(@self, cairo:Context canvas, Rect rect)
    After reloading Cairo, the CodeView module kept a reference to the old type?
   
  Type inference fail in extra_output from if-block

  This code had an error with no source location:
    letterSize = [painter.currentFont.width('AAAAAAAAAA') / 10, painter.currentFont.height] -> Point
  (where width & height both returned null)

Deprecated code to delete
  Unique names (replaced with global names and uniqueOrdinal)
  
Source repro
  Each branch should store the base indent level (instead of having this data in Term)

Code reload
  Bug fix, don't reload if the file has just been written and its size is 0. Maybe have a delay.

Modules
  When compiling a module, the last value is automatically turned into an output (just
    like a function). This should probably be explicit for modules.
