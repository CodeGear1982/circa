state x = (some expression) doesn't work, only state x = value works.
 - Need to change how stateful-value gets its initial value. It can't happen at parse time.

Prefix operators. Need to support -x

Ambiguity with lists and x -y (this could mean [(x - y)] or [x, -y])

Recursive functions have terrible performance. We must be doing something wrong

Related: Subroutines shouldn't duplicate their whole function body by default
 - Should definitely duplicate terms declared as 'state'
 - Also need to duplicate any term which has state in it
 - Although, don't need to duplicate terms which have constant state.
   Maybe we should enforce a distinction? Some functions use state as more of
   a 'configuration' thing, which is more part of the code than the data.
 - Keep in mind, we need to support coroutine yield
 - Aside: need a way for a function header to declare its state type
