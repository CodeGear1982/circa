 - Unary negation doesn't work.
   Can't write this: a = 1; b = -a
   (Negation does work on literals because it's included in the token)

 - Subtraction against a literal sometimes doesn't work (depending on if you added a space)
   Can't write this: 1-2
   The reason is that the tokenizer interprets this as two values, '1' and '-2'

 - Assignment operator should only be allowed to work on values

 - Assignment to a field does not work
   Like this: point.x := 1

 - Types need to be passed by reference
