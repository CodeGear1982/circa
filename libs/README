This directory contains Circa bindings for various 3rd-party libraries.

Currently, the .cpp files are #included by source in plastic/src/app.cpp , which works fine
for now but isn't a good long-term strategy. The long-term plan is that each library binding
will be compiled as a shared object (a .DLL or .SO) and loaded at runtime.
