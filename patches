Idea: patches

A 'patch' is similar to a function, except it is allowed to make structure-changing operations.
Functions can not.

Patches are like functions, except they must always be inlined.

Patches create new terms for every time they are called. Functions create terms only once.

Functions can be compiled so that they are fully layer A. Patches are layer B or C.

Functions can not contain patches. At the lowest level, everything is a function. At the highest
level, everything is a patch.

Patches should be used for things that occur at build-time. Patches should not be called often
at run-time (perhaps they should be altogether impossible at run time?)

Patches can use this syntax:
[source_term] -> [dest_term]
