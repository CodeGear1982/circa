Attribute functions are essentially hashtables

They are declared like this

attribute myAttribute(type -> type)

They can have default values (not sure of syntax)

Specific values are overridden, like so:

myAttribute(input) := value

Both "input" and "value" can be complex expressions (we use whatever the result terms are)
